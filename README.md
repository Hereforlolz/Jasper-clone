Got it — here’s your **Jasper Clone README** styled like your TikTok script generator example: casual, punchy, no fluff, with that “hire me” vibe at the bottom. I’ve kept it original and direct, just like you want.

# 🚀 Jasper AI Clone — \$1.5B in 500 Lines

> The billion-dollar AI writing assistant? I rebuilt it in under 2 hours using just templates, API calls, and a bit of spite.

---

## What is this?

Jasper AI — the VC darling that raised \$125M at a \$1.5B valuation and claims to “revolutionize content creation.”

Spoiler: it’s just templates + ChatGPT API calls.

So, I rebuilt their entire business model in:

* ⏱ about 2 hours
* 💸 zero dollars (free API tiers only)
* 📝 \~500 lines of Python
* 🤖 multi-AI support (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, Hugging Face)

This is a reality check wrapped in code.

---

## What it does

* ✍️ Generates blog posts, social media copy, emails, and product descriptions from simple templates
* 🤖 Supports multiple AI providers — pick your poison: OpenAI GPT, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, or open-source Hugging Face models
* 🛠️ Mock mode included so you can play with no API keys
* 🧩 Tiny codebase, zero fluff, maximum punch

---

## How to run it

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hereforlolz/jasper-clone.git
cd jasper-clone
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

Add your API keys in the sidebar to unlock full power, or just use the free mock mode to test drive the thing.

## Why does this matter?

Because \$1.5B is a hell of a number for “templates + API calls.” This project shows how simple the core tech really is — but also that execution, timing, and hype can move mountains.

If you want someone who:

* Builds quick, lean, functional AI tools
* Understands multi-provider AI integrations
* Sees through the hype and builds what actually works

Yeah, I’m your person.

---

## Tech stack

* Python + Streamlit — zero setup, max speed
* Requests for API calls
* Pure template-driven generation with prompt injection
* Multi-AI provider abstraction layer for flexibility

---

## What’s missing (for now)

* No fancy UI polish — it’s raw and real
* No user accounts or saving
* Limited error handling (you’re smarter than the code)
* No rate limiting or scalability focus yet

---

## Next steps (if I care or get paid)

* Add export options (Markdown, HTML, PDFs)
* Better UI/UX (because some people care)
* More AI providers and template variety
* Production-grade error handling and logging

---

## Compensation & Work Stuff (because you’ll ask)

If you want to hire someone who ships AI tools fast and clean, here’s roughly what it takes:

* **Base:** \$300K–\$375K, depending on timezone and role intensity
* **Equity:** 2–5%, especially for zero-to-one early stage stuff
* **Work Style:** Fully remote, async, no meetings unless urgent
* **Resources:** Access to GPUs, OpenAI credits, and freedom to break things
* **Sponsorship:** Full visa, relocation, pet support included — no nonsense

---

⭐ Star it if you’re tired of overhyped “AI startups” and want to see what real hacking looks like. Fork it, break it, and build something actually useful.
